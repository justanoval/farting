# Farting
That's it. That's the mod.

This mod requires three mods:
- [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer)
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
- [Fzzy Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/fzzy-config)

An optional mod is [Sidebar Potion Display](https://modrinth.com/mod/sidebar-potion). This is useful because the custom potion effects won't show up otherwise, and this one displays custom Polymer effects.

With Polymer, this mod is entirely server-side.

## Features
- Occasionally, when crouching, players will fart.
- Fully data-driven farts, allowing you to configure their weights, particles, sounds, velocity, and (soon) effects.
  - There are two default farts, normal fart and big fart.
    - Normal fart is a short burst with a small particle cloud that pushes you forward slightly.
    - Big fart is a larger burst with a bigger, darker particle cloud that launches you up in the air a bit. This one is rare.
- The chance of a fart happening can be configured (between 0 - 1, 0 being not at all and 1 being 100% of the time).
- Farts trigger sculk sensors; this can be disabled, but it is enabled by default.
- Editing the fart sounds can be done via resource pack.
- Potion Effects
  - **Gassy**: Certain foods give you a Gassy effect, making you more likely to fart (configurable).

I question my life decisions every day.
