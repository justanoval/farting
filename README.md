# Farting
That's it. That's the mod.

This mod is compatible with [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) and does not require a resource pack. It is fully server-sided with Polymer installed. Otherwise, the clients must have it as well to hear the sounds, or a server resource pack must be made.

## Features
- Occasionally, when crouching, players will fart.
- There are three (3) fart audios that have the chance to play.
- The chance of a fart happening can be configured (between 0 - 1, 0 being not at all and 1 being 100% of the time).
- Farts trigger sculk sensors; this can be disabled, but it is enabled by default.
- Editing the fart sounds can be done via resource pack.
